            <h1>About Mindfulness</h1>
            <p><b>Mindfulness</b> is achieved by focusing one’s awareness on the <b>present moment</b>, not dwelling on past events or dreaming of the future, but <b>being in the ‘now’</b>.  It has been proven to <b>decrease levels of anxiety</b>, <b>social conflict</b> & <b>attention disorder</b> among children. It can help both <b>adults and children</b> become more <b>responsive</b> & <b>less reactive</b>, more <b>focused</b> & <b>less distracted</b>, more <b>calm</b> & <b>less stressed</b> creating a more <b>positive</b> human being. It is an easy concept, but quite difficult to master and requires lots of practice through formal and informal <b>meditations</b>.</p>

                The growing interest in mindfulness is an indication that there is a need to <b>slow down</b>, <b>create space</b> and <b>reduce stress</b>. Perhaps the fact that this resonates with many teachers, parents, health care professionals, youth workers and students is also an indication that we are beginning to revisit our understanding of <b>what really matters in learning</b> in the 21st Century - <b>wellbeing</b>, <b>resilience</b> and <b>self-awareness</b> are increasingly recognised as being as important as academic success."

            <h1>What I Teach</h1>
            <p>I teach the <b>12 Week <a onclick="showPage('pawsb')">Paws.b</a> Mindfulness Programme</b> to children aged <b>7</b> to <b>12</b> years old.  I travel to Primary Schools <b>all over Ireland</b>, as well as <b>youth groups</b> and <b>private one-to-one sessions</b>. The programme runs <b>during school hours</b> formally as a series of <b>SPHE lessons</b> based on six themes, teaching one classroom at a time.  Children learn <b>valuable life skills</b> to help them to <b>cope effectively</b> with life’s ups and downs.</p>

            <h2>
                <b>Read what Enable Ireland said about Julieanne and the programme she put together for the children:</b>
            </h2>
            
            <div class="quote-small">
                <br>
                "The children allocated to the group have all been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. These children are mostly surviving in schools with little or no extra supports or resources. This leads to high stress levels and anxiety in our children which can be hard to manage due to frequent outbursts and meltdowns. It has been extremely difficult to find a way for our children to manage their levels of stress independently. Julieanne has brought a whole new dimension to these children’s self-awareness and emotions. Her child friendly programme has allowed the children to explore themselves and their emotions each week. It has encouraged them to stop, take a minute and calm themselves down without the help of others. This is a significant step for some of these children which we have been working on for years! Julieanne has not only been patient and understanding to these children but also very passionate about her work and it has been fantastic working with her."

            <div class="faq-answer">Google what is currently available as <b>funding is released from time to time</b>. Also contact your <b>Parent's Association</b>, local <b>Mental Health Association</b>, or organise <b>fundraising events</b>.</div>
            
            <div class="faq-title">Do you offer one-off taster sessions?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">It takes time to establish Mindfulness practice in the brain so therefore <b>I do not offer taster sessions</b>.  I do however offer <b>one hour introductory talks</b> on Mindfulness and the Paws.b Programme to teachers, staff and parent groups.

            <div class="faq-title">Can you come to my school to train the teachers?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">I trained to teach a <b>specific programme to children</b>. However, when I teach in schools, I ask the class teacher and support staff to participate in each of my sessions. They will gain <b>theoretic knowledge</b>, <b>the correct attitude to attain a mindful classroom</b> and begin to build up <b>their own individual mindfulness practice</b>.  Neuro-science says it takes at least <b>8 weeks of practice</b> to establish mindfulness in the brain. But to make changes permanent the process is often referred to as “<b>use it or lose it</b>”. If you don’t keep firing the neurons repeatedly, the changes <b>do not last long</b>.  On completion of the Paws.b Programme, the class teacher will be <b>confident</b> in continuing the practice with the children but will not gain any teacher training qualifications.   </div>

        <div id="pawsb" class="container noselect">
            <h1>What is Paws.b?</h1>
            <p>Paws.b is a <b>twelve session mindfulness course</b> for primary schools, based on six themes, and ideally taught to <b>7</b> to <b>11</b> year olds. It is adapted from the .b mindfulness curriculum for secondary schools, as well as influenced by adult mindfulness courses such as <b>MBSR</b> & <b>MBCT</b>. It is currently being evaluated by the <b>University of Bangor in the UK</b>.</p>
            <h1>What makes Paws.b distinctive?</h1>
            <p>Paws.b was carefully crafted by classroom teachers and mindfulness experts to <b>engage</b> young children. It is taught with <b>striking visuals</b>, <b>film clips</b> and <b>activities</b> that bring mindfulness to life without losing the <b>expertise</b> and <b>integrity</b> of classic mindfulness teaching.</p>
            <h1>What are Paws.b's objectives?</h1>
            <p>Paws.b aims to give students <b>mindfulness as a life-skill</b>. Students use it...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to feel <b>happier</b>, <b>calmer</b> and <b>more fulfilled</b></li>
                <li>to <b>get on better</b> with others</li>
                <li>to help them <b>concentrate</b> and <b>learn</b> better</li>
                <li>to help <b>cope</b> with <b>stress</b> and <b>anxiety</b></li>
                <li>to support <b>performance</b> such as <b>music</b> and <b>sport</b></li>
            </ul>
            <h1>The Paws.b Curriculum</h1>
            <p>The curriculum consists of <b>12</b> sessions based on <b>6</b> themes:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li><b>Brain Training</b> – this is the neuro-scientific content where children learn about 4 main areas of the brain.  These are the areas that we know can be developed using mindfulness.</li>
                <li><b>Puppy Training</b> - teaches the children how our mind is similar to a puppy: puppies wander off, don’t stay still and bring back things you didn’t ask for.  Our minds wander off, don’t stay focused, and bring us thoughts we didn’t ask for.  Rather than being critical, we accept that this is simply the nature of the mind.</li>
                <li><b>Finding a Steady Place</b> – is about how we sometimes ‘wobble’ emotionally and what we can do to help ourselves.</li>
                <li><b>Dealing with Difficulty</b> – teaches the children about the part of the brain that is responsible for our fight, flight, and freeze reaction.  It teaches how Mindfulness can help you in trigger moments, to pause and simply chose how you wish to respond, rather than reacting and regretting it later.</li>
                <li><b>Story-Telling Mind</b> – teaches how it is our thoughts that actually control our mood and emotions, and how one thought can easily snowball into a big worry.  The children learn to observe their thoughts and practice techniques to settle and calm the mind.</li>
                <li><b>Growing Happiness</b> – is about how we are in control of our own happiness. It teaches the importance of being kind to ourselves as well as others, and how kindness and gratitude are the magic mix for a happy life.</li>
            </ul>

                "The children allocated to the group have all been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. These children are mostly surviving in schools with little or no extra supports or resources. This leads to high stress levels and anxiety in our children which can be hard to manage due to frequent outbursts and meltdowns. It has been extremely difficult to find a way for our children to manage their levels of stress independently. Julieanne has brought a whole new dimension to these children’s self-awareness and emotions. Her child friendly programme has allowed the children to explore themselves and their emotions each week. It has encouraged them to stop, take a minute and calm themselves down without the help of others. This is a significant step for some of these children which we have been working on for years! Julieanne has not only been patient and understanding to these children but also very passionate about her work and it has been fantastic working with her."
