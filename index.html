            <h1>About Mindfulness</h1>
            <p><b>Mindfulness</b> is achieved by focusing one’s awareness on the <b>present moment</b>, not dwelling on past events or dreaming of the future, but <b>being in the ‘now’</b>.  It has been proven to <b>decrease levels of anxiety</b>, <b>social conflict</b> & <b>attention disorder</b> among children. It can help both <b>adults and children</b> become more <b>responsive</b> & <b>less reactive</b>, more <b>focused</b> & <b>less distracted</b>, more <b>calm</b> & <b>less stressed</b> creating a more <b>positive</b> human being. It is an easy concept, but quite difficult to master and requires lots of practice through formal and informal <b>meditations</b>.</p>

            <p>Julieanne has <b>20 years experience</b> working with children of all 
                ages in school settings and out-of-school settings. Julieanne 
                is a trained <b>Montessori teacher</b> and ran her own pre-school and 
                after-school for many years. She also holds a <b>Level 6 Diploma</b> 
                in childcare, is a qualified childcare tutor, and a trained 
                '<a onclick="showPage('pawsb')">Paws.b</a>' Mindfulness Teacher. Julieanne trained in '<a onclick="showPage('pawsb')">Paws.b</a>' in 
                The Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, Bangor 
                University, Wales and is the first '<a onclick="showPage('pawsb')">Paws.b</a>' teacher in Ireland. 
                She travels around Ireland teaching the '<a onclick="showPage('pawsb')">Paws.b</a>' mindfulness 
                programme in <b>schools</b>, <b>out-of-school services</b>, <b>youth clubs</b>, 
                <b>sports clubs</b>, <b>camps</b> etc as well as also providing <b>private 
                    sessions</b>.
                <br>"The growing interest in mindfulness is an indication
                that there is a need to <b>slow down</b>, <b>create space</b> and <b>reduce 
                    stress</b>. Perhaps the fact that this resonates with many teachers,
                parents, health care professionals, youth workers and students 
                is also an indication that we are beginning to revisit our 
                understanding of <b>what really matters in learning</b> in the 21st 
                Century - <b>wellbeing</b>, <b>resilience</b> and <b>self-awareness</b> are 
                increasingly recognised as being as important as academic success".</p>

            <h1>What I Teach</h1>
            <p>I teach the <b>12 Week <a onclick="showPage('pawsb')">Paws.b</a> Mindfulness Programme</b> to children aged <b>7</b> to <b>12</b> years old.  I travel to Primary Schools <b>all over Ireland</b>, as well as <b>youth groups</b> and <b>private one-to-one sessions</b>. The programme runs <b>during school hours</b> formally as a series of <b>SPHE lessons</b> based on six themes, teaching one classroom at a time.  Children learn <b>valuable life skills</b> to help them to <b>cope effectively</b> with life’s ups and downs.</p>

            <p>Mindful Kids Ireland began in <b>September 2014</b> and has since worked in <b>44</b> schools:</p>

            <h1>What is Paws.b?</h1>
            <p>Paws.b is a twelve session mindfulness course for primary schools, based on six themes, and ideally taught to 7 - 11 year olds.
